       "1  ::Kentuckiana is colloquial.  Even though the area is often referred to as this, it (in my opinion) has never held the encyclopedic precision of \"Louisville metropolitian area\", which has a specific U.S. Census definition.  Also, apparently Kentuckiana often refers to the local television viewing area, which isn't nearly contiguous with the official metro area.  As you indicate, Kentuckiana seems to be more of a slang or marketing phenomena than anything we could pin down in encyclopedic terms here.  That's why we see Wikipedia language like \"the Louisville metropolitan area, sometimes referred to as Kentuckiana\". That's my take on it. —   •   \n",
